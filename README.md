# COMP 445 - Lab 1

Goal of the lab is to create a file server using the net package from node. Anything higher than that is considered too abstract. We are also required to connect to this server using a command-line application like curl that we have previously implemented.


The code is in TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. It runs on Node.js. Instructions on compiling are below, but a working build is currently in the `build` folder.

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `tsc` to compile.
1. Run `npm link`.
2. Run `httpfs help`.

# Usage
